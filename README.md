# Data Karkhana

## Description

Data Karkhana is a project focused on building a Hybrid System for file sharing based on both Client Server model and P2P model. We have five components in the system: a tracker, 2 peers, a sender(Alice), and a receiver(Bob). Alice also acts as a peer after sending files to the system. Bob can receive the file but does't act as a peer in the system.
